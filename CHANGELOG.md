# Changelog

## 0.6.0

- `no-comment` renamed to `settle`. The old name read like it was about code comments, which is what `scrap` does, and it named the one rule instead of the job.

## 0.5.0

- `be-me setup` and `be-me refresh`: a new Ghost agent mines the user's own writing (session messages, prompts typed to the coding agent in its local logs, PR comments, PR descriptions, commits) and returns a filled-in voice profile draft for approval. Text written by a tool under the user's name is dropped as evidence.
- `be-me setup` also feeds Ghost the user's own messages to other people, fetched by the skill since Ghost has no browser or connectors: sent messages from a connected chat workspace first, then posts from a public profile the user names. Writing addressed to a person now stays separate from writing addressed to a tool, and work sources get scrubbed before any sample reaches disk.
- `wringer` comment mode reads the voice profile when one exists.
- `scripts/sync-agent.sh` generates every agent from a table and gains `--check`.

## 0.4.0

- `address-feedback` renamed to `no-comment`.

## 0.3.0

- `deep-review` renamed to `wringer`.

## 0.2.0

- `decomment` renamed to `scrap`.

## 0.1.1

- `spit`: quote the frontmatter description so skills.sh discovers the skill.
